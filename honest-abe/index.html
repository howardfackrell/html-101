  	Abraham "Honest Abe" Lincoln
  </h1>
  <h2>
  	President ofthe United States of America, 1861-1865
  </h2>

  <p>
  	Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.  We are met on a great battle-field of that war.  We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.  It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
